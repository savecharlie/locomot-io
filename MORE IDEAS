we should add player engagement as thing that effects our pipeline. like how long someone stay on my site should make the ai learn somehow. hmm. think for 25 thoughts with memory
  searches and web between. 
when a user is playing i want their play data to be live streamed through this whole pipeline to make hot swtiches in the code as it's being played
dont need host and clinet debugging visual anymore
two heads coliding should kill both.*
 heads running into bodies of any kind should be death*
i suspect the metrics page doesn't work
what if we users can see the ai updating? they could see when an update is cooking with a loading bar and then get notified when it drops.
we need to make user data compatable with the currents inputs but also be backwards compatable going forward
need to not do damage with body while invincible*
different arena bug is back and clients enemies (different enemies than host weird) are frozen***
circles need to be chuncky and pixely
different control type, tap left and right sides of screen to go left and right (OLIVE <3) etc.
bullets and crosshairs are staying behind when players die.
graves. maybe high score death get imortalized with a gravestone with the username on it. top recent gravestones stay for a time and drop off. only last, hmm actually im thinking the last top user to die gets a grave stone. maybe they can have a function. aura. maybe powerups spawn there!! yeah that's good.
ai usernames suck
